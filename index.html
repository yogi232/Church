        Situated in Andhra Pradesh, Proddatur is well known for its gold and cotton industries, and hence is called the Second Bombay. 
        It is also referred to as the ‘City of Gold' because of the large-scale gold business that takes place here.
        Apart from this, the city is a perfect getaway for those who believe in God and miracles. The city has places of worship of all different types, from churches and temples to mosques.
        As per Hindu mythology, after Lord Ram killed Ravana and was returning with Sita, he decided to rest in this city and stopped here along the banks of Penna at sunset—which is how the city got its name. 
        Sunset in Telugu is Proddu. Vijaya Dashmi or Dussehra is a festival celebrated here with great pomp and enthusiasm.
